	   	NewBatchEventsSenderWithMaxAllowedError initializes a BatchEventsSender to collect events and send them as a single

	   		batchSize: maximum number of events to reach before sending the batch, default maximum is 500
	   		interval: milliseconds to wait before sending the batch if other conditions have not been met
	   		dataSize: bytes that the overall payload should not exceed before sending, default maximum is 1040000 ~1MiB
